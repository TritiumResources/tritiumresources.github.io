				# Questions
An on-site submission form is in the works! In the meantime, you can send suggestions to this email: [leftistlockbox@gmail.com](mailto:leftistlockbox@gmail.com)

I am not omniscient. Important events and topics will fly under my radar. I'll accidentally post misinformation. That's why it's important for you to send over suggestions for topics I should look into and corrections for any factual errors on this site. 

If you happen to be knowledgeable on a subject that this site lacks, I would greatly appreciate it if you included your own information/sources in your message! It makes my job doing research much easier.
